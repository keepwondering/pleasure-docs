# Parses ava test`s files

I want to be able to parse test files to improve my software development experience

```js
// some code
t.pass()
```

# Returning useful information such as the title, description, code and flags *(skip)*

And the ability of displaying a description of the test in the form of a JSDoc comment
right above the tests.

```js
// some other code
t.pass()
```

# Even todo tests without a sample code are or description are parsed. *(todo)*
